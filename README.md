Project Overview
The Employee Management System is a Spring Boot-based web application that manages employees, departments, and projects. It provides REST API endpoints to perform CRUD operations for employees, departments, and projects. The application can be tested using Postman.

Features
•	Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for Employees, Departments, and Projects.

Technologies Used
•	Java 23 (JDK 23)
•	Spring Boot
•	MySQL (Version 8.0.39)

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
•	Java Development Kit (JDK 23+)
•	MySQL Server (Version 8.0.39+)
•	Apache Maven (for building the project)
Database Setup
•	Create a MySQL database:
CREATE DATABASE employee_management;

•	Update the application.properties file with your MySQL configuration:
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_management
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
•	The application will automatically create the required tables (employees, departments, projects) when you run it.





Build the Application
Use Maven to build the project
•	mvn clean install

Running the Application
After the build, run the Spring Boot application
•	mvn spring-boot:run
The server will start on http://localhost:8080.
